        <h2>Execution context</h2>
        <p>
          As a frontEnd developper you often think about how does js work and how does it
          do what it does? <br> First of all js is not understood by browsers and so
          it does all that it does using a js engine. The right question now to
          have is how does a JS engine understand the code that is given to it
          and how does it work on it ?
        </p>
        <p>
          It first creates a <strong>global execution context</strong>. But what
          is an <span> Execution context </span> ? an execution context simply
          put is a chart that has two columns the <strong>Memory</strong> and
          <strong>Execution</strong> we fill those columns following two phases.
          <br />
          1. First phase is <strong>Initial phase </strong> in which we
          initialise all global variables to "undefined" by putting them into
          the Memory column, when we enconter a function we put their
          declaration into the Memory column as well
          <br />
          2. Second phase is <strong>Execution phase</strong> in which we put
          the line of code related to the variables we've just initialised
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have the lines of code in the column of
          <strong>Execution</strong> whenever we enconter a function call we
          create a <strong>function execution context</strong> which follows the 
          same steps except it belongs to a function and not the window object
        </p>
        <h2>Execution callstack</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we now the gist of how an execution context is created, we move into
          how it is managed. As mentionned above the <span>global execution context</span> 
          is the first to be created, but there is more to this because after creation
          it stores it in an <span>execution stack</span> which is a type of <span>data structure</span>.
          As we said whenever a function call is encountered in the lines of code it creates an execution 
          context where does it go ?
          Onto the stack, on top of the global execution context and then whenever the function is executed 
          the engine pops it out of the stack
        </p>
